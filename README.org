#+TITLE: RAG Search Engine

This is just a simple RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) search engine.

This program was created while following along with the course on [[https://www.boot.dev/u/maker2413][Boot.dev]].

To run the search engine you can do the following:
#+begin_src shell
  uv run main.py
#+end_src
